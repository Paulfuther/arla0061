# arla0061 This is my first attempt at a full stack website. it started as an attempt to delivery python applications to people via the web. That part worked. But then things grew. This project has now morphed into a full HR platform with new hire documentation repositories, communications via sms, whats app, email and phone as we are fully integrated with Twilio. As well as an assortment of other things. Bulk phone calls, training and compliance reviews, incident forms converted to pdf and pushed todrop box and general data management.
It was built with Flask on the back end, html and css on the front along with a host of javascript for interactivity. I use celery and rabbit mq for task ques as wellas sendgrid for email management.
